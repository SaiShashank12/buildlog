## Known Issues

### Data Migration
- **Issue:** Projects created before authentication have `user_id: "demo_user"` and won't show for new users
- **Impact:** Low - only affects existing demo data
- **Solutions Available:**
  1. Create migration endpoint
  2. Manual database update
  3. Start fresh
  4. Admin view to access all data

**Status:** Not blocking, can be addressed if needed
